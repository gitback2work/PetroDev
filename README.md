# PetroDev

The file PowerService.dll was decompiled to provide a richer test and development environment. The code for this dll is in the project "Services" and this project is referenced in the other projects. The reason it has been left this way is to show the methodology used in decompiling the provided dll file. It is a trivial exercise to replace the project with the given dll which is in the "External" folder.
